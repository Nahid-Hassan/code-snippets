# Add image in markdown
    To do this using ![alter text](url/ image_path "also can use tooltip text"). 

    ! -> Says that this is an image.
    [] -> Alternate text
    () -> url/image_path
    "tooltip_text" -> url _space_ "tooltip_text"

## Example - 1
![wow great image](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.XBAG1kug3kec2UtrvkZ4EQHaEK%26pid%3DApi&f=1 "This is the tooltip")

## Example - 2
    To do this using ![alter_text][number/token]
    
    ! -> Says that this is an image
    [alter_text] -> First square brackets
    [token] -> second square brackets

![Another example][image_path]

[image_path]: https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.sV7tva-728oySeOUL0-vOwHaHa%26pid%3DApi&f=1

## Example - 3
    Use image as a link

    [![alter_text](url)](url)

    []() -> Says that this is a link
    ![]() -> Says that this is an image
    
    Now, [ ![]() ]() - > link[image]. Or we can say that image as a link.


[![image](http://unplash.it/50/50?image=1000)](http://unplash.it/500/500?image=1000)

    [![image](http://unplash.it/50/50?image=1000)](http://unplash.it/500/500?image=1000)

    Sadly say's this url is not work. But to aim this example is that firstly you see a little image, next if you click on this little image you can see a bigger image.

    or you can use...
    [<img src='url' >](url). You see the same effect of this [![]()]()

## Example - 4
    This example is not working with Github. But if you write a blog or something like this you can use this method....

    <img src='url' height="500" width=100% alt='Alternate text'>

    <style>
        img {
            width: 200px;
            height: 300px;
        }
    </style>

        height: 200px;
    }
