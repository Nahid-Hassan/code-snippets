## Make word *italic*
    To make a word *italic* using single * word *. Here you don't use any space before and after word.

## Make word **bold**
    To make a word **bold** using double ** word **. Here you don't use any space before and after word.

## Another way to make a word _italic_ and __bold__
    Using single _ word _ underscore for italic, and __ word __ underscore for bold.

## Strike throw in a ~~word~~ or sentence (Example: ~~Hello, how are you?~~).
    Using double ~~ word/words/sentence ~~ to make a word/line is strike.
