    <p>
        A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
        automatically
        via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called
        programs.
        These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the
        hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation
        can be
        referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and
        work
        together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.

        A laptop or laptop computer, is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a "clamshell" form factor,
        typically
        having a thin LCD or LED computer screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid of the clamshell and an
        alphanumeric
        keyboard on the inside of the lower lid. The clamshell is opened up to use the computer. Laptops are folded shut
        for
        transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.[1] Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed to be placed
        on a
        person's lap when being used. Although originally there was a distinction between laptops and notebooks (the
        former
        being bigger and heavier than the latter), as of 2014, there is often no longer any difference. Today, laptops
        are
        commonly used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games, web browsing, for
        personal
        multimedia, and general home computer use.
