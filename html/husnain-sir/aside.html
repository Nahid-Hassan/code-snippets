        <h1>Computer</h1>
        <p>
            A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
            automatically
            via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called
            programs.
            These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including
            the
            hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full"
            operation can be
            referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected
            and work
            together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.

        <h1>Laptop</h1>
        <p>A laptop or laptop computer, is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a "clamshell" form factor,
            typically
            having a thin LCD or LED computer screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid of the clamshell and an
            alphanumeric
            keyboard on the inside of the lower lid. The clamshell is opened up to use the computer. Laptops are folded
            shut for
            transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.</p>
