Types of Machine Learning
-------------------------
	* Supervised vs Unsupervised
	* Online vs Batch 
	* Instance-based vs Model-based

Supervised/Unsupervised
----------------------
Supervised
----------
	* K-Nearest Neighbor's
	* Linear-regression
	* Logistic-regression
	* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	* Decision tree and Random Forests
	* Neural Networks

Note: Some neural networks architectures can be,
	Unsupervised
	------------
		* Auto-encoders
		* Restricted Boltzmann Machine
	Semisupervised
	--------------
		* Deep Belif Networks
		* Unsupervised Pretraining

Unsupervised
------------
	Clustering
	----------
		* K-Means
		* Hierarchical Cluster Analysis(HCA)
		* Expectation Maximization
	Visualization and dimensionality reduction
	------------------------------------------
		* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
		* Kernel PCA
		* Local Linear Embedding (LLE)
		* t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
	Association rule learning
	-------------------------
		* Apriori
		* Eclat

* Anomaly detection(remove outliers)

Association rule
----------------
	People who,
		Purchase barbecue Sauce --> also by ---> potato chips ---> and also tend to buy ---> steak
		A ------> B --------> C -------> D

Semisupervised
--------------
	* Goole Photos
	* RBM

Reinforcement Learning
----------------------
	* Agent learn from environment based on reward.
	* Ex: Robot walks, DeepMind Alpha Go.

Batch Learning
--------------
	* Offline learning
	
			lots-of-data ----> training ------> Production

Online Learning
---------------
	* Mini batch learning or learn incrementally from a stream of incoming data.

Instance-based Learning
--------------------------------------
This is called instance-based learning: the system learns the examples by heart, then
generalizes to new cases using a similarity measure

Model-based Learning
--------------------
Another way to generalize from a set of examples is to build a model of these exam‚Äê
ples, then use that model to make predictions. This is called model-based learning.
